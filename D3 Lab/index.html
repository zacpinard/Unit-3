        <h1 id="title">Populations of Big 5 Game in African National Parks</h1>
        <p id="text">The "Big Five" game species in Africa refer to elephants, lions, leopards, buffalo, and rhinos. The term was originally coined by big game hunters to refer to the five hardest species in Africa to hunt on foot.  However, it has since become more widely used by game-viewing tourists and safari operators in African national parks and reserves.  Since many of the Big Five are keystone species that have a disproportionately large effect on their ecosystem, the populations of each species in a national park can provide insight into the overall ecological health of the park. The map below details the Big Five populations in 15 of Africa's most popular national parks and reserves. Because specific species population data is difficult to obtain, data was retrieved from a variety of sources and from a variety of years in the past decade. Many of these figures are estimates. However, the map provides an overall picture of the relative populations of Big Five species in some of Africa's most prominent wild spaces, and is worth a look before planning your next safari!</p>
